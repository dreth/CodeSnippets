# Phishing site spammer

I made this with the sole purpose of spamming the databases of uni airdrop sites, given that there's so many scams going on.

It's very simple, just creates 500 processes with the function spam which is an infinite loop of post requests inside a try-except block in case any error happens, continue the loop and keep spamming.

It notifies you every 10 requests are made in each process.

It's pretty simple but I found it kinda fun to do at 2am

Partly inspired by this repo: https://github.com/DanielBence/trolling-scammers, where I also took the name list from!
